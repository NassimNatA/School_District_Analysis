# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas high school due to an error in the data integrity that projected altered grades. After replacing the math and reading scores with NaNs and keeping the rest of the data intact, the school district analysis was repeated with the following report detailing the changes. The following deliverables are included: 
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - School performance based on the budget per student
    - School performance based on the school size 
    - School performance based on the type of school
