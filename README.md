# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas high school due to an error in the data integrity that projected altered grades.

The following deliverables are included: 
- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
